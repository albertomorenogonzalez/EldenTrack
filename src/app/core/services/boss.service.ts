He is a descendant of Godfrey and thus born of the golden lineage, but Gideon and Kenneth Haight believe him to be weak and unworthy to rule. Much of Godrick`s power comes from the arms and legs of soldiers he`s grafted onto himself, and especially the dragon head grafted onto his left arm during the second phase of his fight. His knights and soldiers wear armor that bears emblems of the golden lineage: a two-headed war-axe and the beast regent, Serosh.',

When he and his twin brother Mohg were born, they were imprisoned deep in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds for being born as Omen royalty. Despite how it treated him, Morgott still loved the Golden Order, and he defended the capital when his fellow demigods invaded during the Shattering. His loyalty was unfortunately not enough for him to be considered worthy of the Elden Throne, however.',

The Fire Giants worshipped the One-Eyed/Fell God and was one of the few factions Queen Marika waged war on. The Golden Order feared the `flame of ruin`` capable of burning down the Erdtree found within their forge, and so it is believed that Marika slew their god and cursed the last of the Fire Giants to guard the forge for eternity.',

The Ancient Dragon and Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones are said to be scales of the Dragonlord.

In order for this to never happen again, he imbued the rune into his very flesh.',
